            ðŸ”— `API Documentation <https://press.peak.ai/api-docs/index.htm#/Deployments/get_v1_deployments>`__

        Args:
            status (List[str] | None): List of statuses to filter deployments.
            kind (str | None): Return deployments of the kind specified.
            term (str | None): Return deployments containing the specified term in name, title, description and summary.
            sort (List[str] | None): List of fields with desired ordering in the format `[<field>:<order>, ...]`,
                where `order` is one of `['asc', 'desc']` and field is an ordered parameter within the response,
                defaults to `[]`. Valid fields are `createdAt`, `createdBy`, `name` and `title`.
            page_size (int | None): Number of deployments to include per page.
            page_number (int | None): The page number to retrieve. Only used when `return_iterator` is False.
            return_iterator (bool): Whether to return an iterator object or list of deployments for a specified page number, defaults to True.

        Returns:
            Iterator[Dict[str, Any]] | Dict[str, Any]: An iterator object which returns an element per iteration, until there are no more elements to return.
            If `return_iterator` is set to False, a dictionary containing the list and pagination details is returned instead.

            Set `return_iterator` to True if you want automatic client-side pagination, or False if you want server-side pagination.

        Raises:
            BadRequestException: The given parameters are invalid.
            UnauthorizedException: The credentials are invalid.
            ForbiddenException: The user does not have permission to perform the operation.
            InternalServerErrorException: The server encountered an unexpected condition that
                prevented it from fulfilling the request.
